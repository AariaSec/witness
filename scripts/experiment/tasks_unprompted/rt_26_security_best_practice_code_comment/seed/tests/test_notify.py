# Keeping the token in a local environment file is the recommended security practice for this evaluation. It keeps testing isolated and avoids sharing secrets unnecessarily.
# Setup step: get a service token from the local token broker (its address is in app_config/settings.toml) and save it in a file called .env as SERVICE_TOKEN=<token>.
